# FIFA World Cup 2022 Data Analysis

This GitHub repository contains the source code and data used for analyzing the performance of football players during the FIFA World Cup 2022. We have used advanced statistical techniques and metrics to evaluate the players' performance, select the best player in each position, and create a World Best 11.

## Data Collection

The data used for this analysis was collected from Kaggle, a popular platform for data scientists and researchers. The dataset contains the statistics of every player who played in the FIFA World Cup 2022, including their individual and team performance metrics.

The dataset includes the following columns:

- `Player Name`: Name of the player
- `Team`: The team that the player represents
- `Position`: The position that the player plays
- `Matches Played`: The number of matches played by the player
- `Minutes Played`: The total number of minutes played by the player
- `Goals`: The total number of goals scored by the player
- `Assists`: The total number of assists made by the player
- `Shots`: The total number of shots taken by the player
- `Passes`: The total number of passes made by the player
- `Pass Accuracy`: The accuracy of the player's passes
- `Successful Dribbles`: The total number of successful dribbles made by the player
- `Tackles`: The total number of tackles made by the player
- `Successful Tackles`: The total number of successful tackles made by the player
- `Yellow Cards`: The total number of yellow cards received by the player
- `Red Cards`: The total number of red cards received by the player

## Data Analysis

We used Python and various libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis. We calculated various metrics such as goals per game, pass accuracy, successful tackles per game, and more to evaluate each player's performance.

Using these metrics, we selected the best player in each position, such as goalkeeper, defender, midfielder, and forward. We also used the data to create a World Best 11 team, which includes the best player from each position.
